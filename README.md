## Requirements

* Python 3
* GDAL libraries and python bindings installed locally (you generally want to install these bindings using the OS package manager, not pip)
* A local postgres database with PostGIS installed.
* A user account on the [Copernicus Open Access Hub](https://scihub.copernicus.eu/).

##Â Installation

Git clone this repo and run `pip3 install .`. It's best to install this using the system python rather than a virtualenv so that the system GDAL library is used.

## Configuration

Create `sarfetcher.cfg` either in the local directory or in `/etc`:
```
[db]
url = postgresql://user@host/sentinel1

[sentinel]
username = scihub_username
password = scihub_password
```

## How to use

Run `sarfetcher import -d 30`. This will import the last 30 days of image metadata from the Sentinel hub into the PostGIS database.

Now you need to insert one row into the `search_area` table, containing a multipolygon representing the area you want to download. (An example for the North Sea/English Channel is below.)

Once this is complete, you can fetch the images which cover your search area:

`sarfetcher fetch ./output_directory`

This will download and process a set of images, putting the finished .tif files in `output_directory`. It will delete any images from that directory which are no longer current. For the North Sea/English Channel area this dataset is approximately 55GB in size.

The the `import` and `fetch` steps can be run periodically to update the data.
